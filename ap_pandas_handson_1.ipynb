Dining Place is clean but washrooms were not.\\\\n\\\\nThe service staff were prompt but the aroma was not that appealing. Food was served fast but I felt it wasn't much different from some fast food joints. Nothing special to mention or remember. What I felt is they have their customers, those people who comes late night in big family groups.\\\"), ('Rated 3.0', 'RATED\\\\n  200 is all it takes to fill you up..

Like its neighbor, they serve nice kebabs. I am not impressed with their biriyanis though. It is a better option to opt for ghee rice and gravy. And it is wiser and best to choose the ghee rice combo that they offer. Not only it is economical, it contains the best that you can choose from this place in it.\\\\n\\\\nsrirelishes.blogspot.com'), ('Rated 3.5', 'RATED\\\\n  Their Biryani is finger licking wow!!
